Hi, I’m TJ also known as Tony.

I currently work as a math teacher, though I spent time as an English teacher, particularly for native Spanish/Castellano learners and I like to use a lot of Python and HTML for preparing my lesson materials. 

Most of my educational materials can be found at my github pages site [TonyTerrasa.github.io](TonyTerrasa.github.io). However, you can also find a lot of activities in a (currently not-running) CATSOOP site tj001.space ([repo here](https://github.com/TonyTerrasa/tj.001)).


In university I studied Electromechanical Engineering (2A-6 at MIT), where I learned to code, particularly with a focus on signal processing. On my Github, you can find some of these projects like:
- [pyAudioFilter](https://github.com/TonyTerrasa/pyAudioFilter)
- [MicrophoneTestingTurnTable](https://github.com/TonyTerrasa/MicrophoneTestingTurnTable)
