Hi, I’m TJ also known as Tony.

I currently work as an English teacher where I like to use a lot of Python for preparing my lesson materials. 

My main website for this year is built on the [CATSOOP](https://catsoop.mit.edu/website) framework and is called [TJ.001](https://tj001.space).

In university I studied Electromechanical Engineering (2A-6 at MIT), where I learned to code, particularly with a focus on signal processing.
